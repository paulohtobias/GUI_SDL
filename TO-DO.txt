* Create a struct RenderData (Widget, SDL_Renderer, Camera) to pass to all render related functions.
	- Create a function in Camera to give the Position (or SDL_Rect) relative to it.
	- Remove the rendering_camera field from Widget.
	- Debug the Label render_copy method.
	- Border.bounds now will have the same value as widget local bounds.
	- Border.draw will work like the render_copy of TWidgets.

* Create a struct EventData to be passed to the process_events functions.

* (DONE) Add a get_bounds function at the default widget functions struct.
	- This is needed in case the widget have borders and want to pass the border bounds instead of its own bounds
